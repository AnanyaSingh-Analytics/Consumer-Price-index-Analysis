This project is a data-driven case study analyzing **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** trends in India. Using Excel, I explored key inflation metrics across time, categories, and locations to extract meaningful insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze the trend of overall CPI inflation over recent years  
2. Identify categories with the highest inflation impact  
3. Compare urban vs rural inflation patterns  
4. Track YoY inflation changes by commodity group  
5. Visualize key inflation trends using charts and summaries
